## [3.0.0] - 2025-12-25

### 🎉 MAJOR RELEASE - Complete CLI Architecture Transformation

This is a **major breaking release** that fundamentally transforms the framework from npm script-based workflows to a pure CLI-driven architecture. The package has been completely rewritten, tested, and optimized for production use.

### 🆕 Interactive Requirements Mode

Running `npx agentic15 plan` without arguments now enters **interactive mode**:
- Type or paste requirements of any length
- Include URLs, detailed specs, multiple paragraphs
- Press Ctrl+D (Mac/Linux) or Ctrl+Z+Enter (Windows) to save
- No shell escaping or quote issues
- Perfect for complex corporate websites, detailed project specs

**Example**:
```bash
npx agentic15 plan
# Paste your requirements...
# Press Ctrl+D when done
```

### 💥 Breaking Changes

**CRITICAL**: This release is **NOT backward compatible** with v1.x or v2.x workflows.

1. **All npm scripts removed** - Use `npx agentic15 <command>` instead
   - ❌ `npm run plan:generate` → ✅ `npx agentic15 plan "description"`
   - ❌ `npm run plan:init` → ✅ `npx agentic15 plan` (auto-locks)
   - ❌ `npm run task:start` → ✅ `npx agentic15 task next`
   - ❌ No task:done - Status auto-detected by CLI

2. **No obfuscated/minified code** - Ships pure ESM source code
   - Removed 248KB of minified v1.x code
   - Transparent, auditable codebase
   - Easier debugging and contributions

3. **Built-in plan logic** - No external script dependencies
   - Plan generation/locking logic moved into PlanCommand class
   - No npm script wrapper required
   - Single command for entire workflow

4. **v2.0 schema support** - Updated PROJECT-PLAN.json structure
   - Root level uses `project` (singular) instead of `projects` (plural)
   - Compatible with PROJECT-PLAN-TEMPLATE.json format
   - Recursive task extraction from nested structures

### ✨ What's New

#### CLI Commands (All New)
```bash
npx agentic15 auth              # One-time GitHub setup
npx agentic15 plan "desc"       # Generate plan requirements
npx agentic15 plan              # Lock plan (if PROJECT-PLAN.json exists)
npx agentic15 task next         # Auto-start next pending task
npx agentic15 task start ID     # Start specific task
npx agentic15 commit            # Test, commit, push, create PR
npx agentic15 status            # Show current progress
```

#### GitHub Integration
- ✅ Issue templates (.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.md)
- ✅ PR templates (.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
- ✅ CLI uses templates for consistent formatting
- ✅ Auto-generated issues follow standard structure

- 🧪 Black box tested - 5 critical bugs found and fixed
- ✅ All core workflows verified end-to-end
- 📚 Complete documentation with workflow diagrams

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes (Found During Testing)

All bugs discovered and fixed during comprehensive black box testing:

1. **Import Path Error** (bin/create-agentic15-claude-zen.js:179)
   - Fixed: dist/index.js → src/index.js

2. **Template Path Error** (src/core/TemplateManager.js:32)
   - Fixed: Added '../..' to reach package root from src/core/

3. **Obsolete Method Call** (src/core/ProjectInitializer.js)
   - Removed: extractBundledFiles() call (tried to copy non-existent scripts)

4. **Schema Compatibility** (src/cli/PlanCommand.js:207-210)
   - Added: Support for v2.0 schema with singular 'project' at root

5. **Wrong Method Reference** (src/cli/TaskCommand.js:155-158)
   - Fixed: Now calls correct TaskIssueMapper.taskToIssueTitle/Body/Labels methods

### 📊 Testing & Verification

- ✅ **Test Repository**: https://github.com/agentic15/agentic15-test-v2
- ✅ **Project Creation**: Templates, dependencies, git, hooks
- ✅ **Plan Generation**: Requirements file, plan ID, ACTIVE-PLAN
- ✅ **Plan Locking**: Task extraction (3/3 tasks verified)
- ✅ **Task Management**: Auto-start next task, feature branch creation
- ✅ **Git Workflow**: Feature branches, status tracking
